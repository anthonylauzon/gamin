# Check the flood control under dnotify
# Scenario: the main thread watch a file, a second thread is created
#  writing 10 times a sec to that file, then after 5 seconds it stops
#  and stops modifying the file for 6 seconds.
#  the kernel monitoring should be stopped within one second in the
#  first phase and then reactivated after a few seconds in the second
#  phase.
#  Difference from flood.py is that we also monitor a second file and
#  flood it but later and with an overlapping in time (5s of flooding
#  and 3s of delay between both start)
