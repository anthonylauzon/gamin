<p>Gamin is a file and directory monitoring system defined to be a subset of
the <a href="http://oss.sgi.com/projects/fam/">FAM</a> (File Alteration
Monitor) system. This is a service provided by a library which allows to
detect when a file or a directory has been modified.</p>

<h2><a name="Overview">Overview</a></h2>

<p>Gamin is a file and directory monitoring system defined to be a subset of
the <a href="http://oss.sgi.com/projects/fam/">FAM</a> (File Alteration
Monitor) system.</p>

<p>The main goals of the project are:</p>
<ol>
  <li>minimize the security model of FAM, the daemon runs under the user
    account, it is compatible with SELinux</li>
  <li>simplify the code base, dropping some of the most exotic feature of
  FAM</li>
  <li>provide an API and ABI compatible replacement for FAM</li>
  <li>try to fix some other issues like resource consumption</li>
</ol>

<p>Gamin also serves as an interface to test the inotify mechanism to improve
the existing dnotify monitoring interface present in the Linux kernel.</p>

<p>At this point Gamin is fairly tied to Linux, portability is not a primary
goal at this stage but if you have portability patches they are welcome.</p>

<p>From an historical point of view, gamin builds from the marmot project
authored by James Willcox and Corey Bowers and then heavilly modified to turn
it into a minimalist FAM replacement (French litterate will appreciate the
filiation from fam to marmot and gamin.)</p>

<p>This library is available under the terms of the <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html">GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC
LICENSE</a>, and a <a

<h2><a name="Using">Using gamin</a></h2>

<p>Basically it is exactly like for using the fam interface. From a
programmer point of view this is the same API, and one can make use of <a

existing FAM documentation</a>. </p>

<p>Then the best way is to log the bug in one of the bugzilla or <a

and post there if you think that some of gamin design or code should be
changed. If you can provide a <a href="debug.html">testgam</a> scenario
reproducing the problem this would really help getting it debugged and fixed,
see examples in tests/scenario/ .</p>

<h2><a name="FAQ">FAQ</a></h2>

<p>This will be created as user feedback is provided.</p>

<h2><a name="Debug">Debugging Gamin</a></h2>

<h3>Debugging support in gamin:</h3>

<p>Both the client and server side, if compiled with debug support accept an
environment variable <strong>GAM_DEBUG</strong> which is set will make them
report debugging informations to stdout.</p>

<p>Usually for debugging you also want to use a dedicated server process so
setting the <strong>GAM_CLIENT_ID</strong> environment allows to ensure this.
Usually one also want to keep control over the server lifetime and not have
it exit automatically after 30 seconds without connection, there is a command
line flag <strong>--notimeout</strong> to <strong>gam_server</strong> for
this.</p>

<p>A typical example of a debugging session using 2 shells would be:</p>
<pre>shell1: export GAM_DEBUG=
shell1: gam_server --notimeout test</pre>

<p>to run the server in debug mode using the ID "test"</p>
<pre>shell2: export GAM_DEBUG=
shell2: export GAM_CLIENT_ID=test
shell2: gamin_client</pre>

<p>to run the client in a verbose session. It is perfectly possible to also
run the client under a debugger, for the server it works too except the
dnotify kernel interface uses a signal SIG33 which is trapped by gdb. To
avoid this use the handle gdb instruction:</p>
<pre>(gdb) handle SIG33 nostop
Signal        Stop      Print   Pass to program Description
SIG33         No        Yes     Yes             Real-time event 33
(gdb)</pre>

<p>even better add it to your <strong>$HOME/.gdbinit</strong> .</p>

<h3>Debugging and testing program:</h3>

<p>A debugging client program called <strong>testgam</strong> is also
available in the tests subdirectory. It allow to use the interface and
monitor the flow of event received. Here is an example of a session:</p>
<pre>paphio:~/gamin/tests -&gt; export GAMIN_DEBUG_SERVER="../server/gam_server"
paphio:~/gamin/tests -&gt; ./testgam -
&gt; connect test
connected to test
&gt;</pre>

<p>The environment variable can be used to specify the path to the server to
run, then <strong>testgam</strong> is launched in interactive mode (argument
<strong>-</strong> ) and the program is asked to connect to the server for
session test (the server will be started on-demand by the library if
needed).</p>
<pre>&gt; mkdir temp
mkdir temp
&gt; mkfile temp/foo
mkfile temp/foo
&gt; mondir temp
mondir temp 0
&gt;
1: /u/veillard/gamin/tests/temp Exists: NULL
1: foo Exists: NULL
1: /u/veillard/gamin/tests/temp EndExist: NULL
&gt; mkfile temp/bar
mkfile temp/bar
&gt;
1: bar Created: NULL
&gt; rmfile temp/foo
rmfile temp/foo
&gt;
1: foo Deleted: NULL
&gt;</pre>

<p>In this example a new directory is created with a file in it and then
monitored, then the directory content is modified. The
<strong>testgam</strong> program also poll and report events coming from the
server as they arrive.</p>

<h2><a name="Security">Security</a></h2>

<p>While gamin still use a server to provide the service (ideally if the
kernel had a proper interface a library only implementation should be doable
and probably better), it tries to avoid security hazard associated to
contacting an external server process:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the server runs under the same privilege level as the client, by
    running under the uid, no root or superuser access is involved, this is
    checked by both side using kernel support for the checking</li>
  <li>when possible (e.g. on Linux) the socket used to communicate is not
    mapped at the filesystem level to avoid risks related to opening a real
    file, if the kernel doesn't allow this a per user directory holding the
    socket is used and appropriate rights are checked.</li>
  <li>to limit DoS attacks done by continuously modifying a monitored
    resource, the daemon will switch back monitoring of very busy resources
    to polling with generation of events only once per second.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is the process used to acquire and create the sockets:</p>

<h3>If there is abstract socket support:</h3>

<p>Use the filename "\0/tmp/fam-$USER-$GAM_CLIENT_ID". They are not mapped on
the filesystem, no attack is possible that way. The client and the server
checks on the first '\0' byte received from the socket that the other side is
running under the same UID.</p>

<h3>If there is no abstract socket support: </h3>

<p>On the server side:</p>
<pre> start:
  try to create /tmp/fam-$USER using mkdir('/tmp/fam-$USER', 007)
  if error:
      make a stat() on it
      if doesn't exist:
          return failure to create
      if user is not getuid() or mode is not 007 or type is not dir:
          try to unlink()
          if error:
              exit with error.
          if success:
              goto start:
                                                                                
  do the socket()/bind() on /tmp/fam-$USER/fam-$GAM_CLIENT_ID</pre>

<p>On the client side:</p>
<pre>  make a stat on /tmp/fam-$USER
  if doesn't exist:
      return failure to create should start the server
  if user is not getuid() or mode is not 007 or type is not dir:
      try to unlink()
      if error:
          exit with error.
      if success:
          return failure should start the server
  make a stat on /tmp/fam-$USER/fam-$GAM_CLIENT_ID
  if doesn't exist:
      return failure to create should start the server
  if user is not getuid() or type is not socket:
      try to unlink()
      if error:
          exit with error.
      if success:
          return failure should start the server
                                                                                
  do the socket()/connect() on /tmp/fam-$USER/fam-$GAM_CLIENT_ID</pre>

<p>The client and the server checks on the first '\0' byte received that the
other side is of the same UID.</p>
