Gamin is a file and directory monitoring system defined to be
a subset of the FAM (File Alteration Monitor) system.
                                                                                
 The main goals of the project are:
 1/ minimize the security model of FAM
 2/ simplify the code base
 3/ provide an API and ABI compatible replacement for FAM
