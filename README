Marmot is a file and directory monitoring system.

NOTES:

* You need Doxygen installed to build the documentation.  If you have this,
  simply run 'doxygen', and you will find html and man pages in doc/api/html
  and doc/api/man respectively.  Latex documentation is also produced in
  doc/api/latex.  Run 'make ps' or 'make pdf' in that directory to produce
  PostScript or PDF docs.
